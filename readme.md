This is an example using [Daleel](https://daleel.kalimah-apps.com/) documentation generator to generate larvel documentation from it API and markdown files.

It shows how http files can be used to download files from GitHub and then use Daleel to generate documentation from it.

It also shows how to use versioning in Daleel. It includes the latest three versions of laravel.

### Example
You can view the documentation here: https://daleel.kalimah-apps.com/laravel

### View config
View [daleel.php](./daleel.php) file to see how it is configured.

> Please note that you might find some broken or style issues. This is due to the fact that Laravel markdown files are pulled from a different server and not created according to Daleel's standards.
